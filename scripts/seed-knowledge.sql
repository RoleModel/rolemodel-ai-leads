  'What sets RoleModel apart:

**Nearly 30 Years of Experience**: Founded in the mid-1990s, we''ve seen technology trends come and go. This experience helps us recommend proven solutions while staying current with modern best practices.

**Client-First Approach**: We start by deeply understanding your business, not by pitching solutions. Every project begins with discovery to ensure we''re solving the right problems.

**Iterative Development**: We don''t disappear for months and then deliver a finished product. Our process involves regular check-ins, demos, and opportunities to adjust direction based on what we learn together.

**Sustainable, Scalable Solutions**: We build software that grows with your business. Our code is maintainable, well-documented, and designed to evolve as your needs change.

**Collaborative Partnership**: You''re not just a client - you''re a partner. We work alongside your team, share our knowledge, and aim to leave you more capable than when we started.'

-- When RoleModel is a Good Fit

  'When RoleModel is a Good Fit',
  'RoleModel is an excellent choice when:

- You need **custom software** built specifically for your business processes (not an off-the-shelf solution)
- You value **quality and craftsmanship** over quick, cheap solutions
- You''re looking for a **long-term technology partner**, not just a vendor
- Your project requires **UI/UX expertise** - you want software that users actually enjoy using
- You need to **integrate multiple systems** or modernize legacy applications
- You want an **iterative, collaborative** development process with regular feedback cycles
- You have a project timeline of weeks to months (not days)
- You appreciate **transparent communication** and honest technical guidance

We''re probably NOT the best fit if:
- You need a simple website or basic landing page (we can recommend better-suited partners)
- You''re looking for the absolute cheapest option
- You want a completely hands-off approach with no input needed
- Your timeline is extremely rushed with no flexibility
- You''re looking for staff augmentation rather than a development partner'
